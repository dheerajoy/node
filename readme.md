# Node.js

- Node js is a open source and cross platform runtime environment for executing Javascript code outside of the browser.
- it is build on google chrome's V8 Engine and is ideal for scalable and high performance applications.
- In node we don't have Browser environment objects such as window or the document object. Instead we have other objects not specific to browser such as file system, operating System, Network, etc.
- Node Applications are single-threaded. That means a single thread is used to handle all clients.
